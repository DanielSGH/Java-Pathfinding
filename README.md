# Building
This project was created in IntelliJ IDEA, but to make it more accessible, you can use these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanielSGH/Java-Pathfinding.git && cd ./Java-Pathfinding && javac AStarMaze.java
```

This was tested on OpenJDK 18.0.1.1, use `java AStarMaze` to run the program.
